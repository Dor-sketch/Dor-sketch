# 🚀 **Dor Pascal**

Hello and welcome! I'm a budding computer scientist with a deep-rooted legal background. My mission is to bridge the gap between law and technology, but for now, I'm focused on landing a role as a software engineering student.

📌 **Location**: Tel Aviv District, Israel

## 🌟 **About Me**
* 📘 With a comprehensive legal tenure at the Israel Defense Forces, I've honed analytical and advisory skills which I'm eager to pair with my newfound passion for software development.
* 💡 Proficient in `C`, `C++`, and `Python`, I'm committed to driving meaningful change through tech solutions.
* 🎯 I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my software skills, with a keen interest in software engineering roles. If you're searching for a candidate with a unique blend of expertise, I'd love to chat!
